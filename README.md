## Install

1. Download and install the latest version of python 2.7

2. Download and install the p4a library

3. Create a local_settings.py file and inside it put the following line

profile_folder = r'C:\Users\sux\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\Moore'

This should point to wherever your a3 profile folder lives.


4. Run the command python make.py.  This will assemble and install the mission.



## Developing

This is still WIP and kinda a pain in the ass.  Will be scripted one day.  Manually copy the 3d mission to your missions folder, and the _core mission to your MPmissions.

You will now be able to make changes to either mission, however you will have to manually copy the files back after any change made in the editor before running make.py again.
